## API's Used:

    - Used in Asian Drama


### Some things to NOTE on installing and using the app:
- Some Asian Dramas are included in Movies and Series API, it would then depend on the user how he/she classfies 'em.
- The app only stores the Poster Image and Title of an Item in the collection. It is not made as a tracker *(but this might be included if possible in the future)* but just some collection for random stuffs.
- There might be some page design changes in the near future.

## TBA (To Be Added) / TODO:
- [ ] Add user Reset Password functionality (Forgot Password?)
- [ ] A User should be able to change his/her profile picture
- [ ] Capability to add custom items in the collections
- [ ] Fix future errors and bugs in the future
- [ ] etx...
